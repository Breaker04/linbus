TODO list for Linbus Analyzer

SCHEMATIC
* Feed power led from 5v instead of 12v. This way it will have the same intensity
when powering from usb only (change resistor to 3.3k).

LAYOUT
* Add version label on bottom of PCB (similar to Beeper).
* Change header pads to round x 0.07 diameter.
* Make the linbus header labels more visible when using right angle headers (currently hidden).
* Add 20mils to the top of the board to match border of the right hangle headers.

SOFTWARE

MISCELLANEOUS
* Add BOM document.
* Improve documentation (e.g. how to attache to the car).
* Verify serial dumper on Windows.
